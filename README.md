# TCoin
#### How *not* to make an IRC bot
I wrote it some time ago as a horrible hybrid of C code which calls shell commands to do all of the actuall processing. Now the API I used is defunct, so there's that. I will hopefully rewrite this one day, but until that day comes have fun figuring out what the difference between TCoin.c and TCoin2.c is, because I sure as hell don't know.
